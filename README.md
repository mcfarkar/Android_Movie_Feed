### Notes

I had trouble getting the YouTube trailer to work. I also got the "There was a problem with the network[400]" error.  I tried some of the solutions offer in the slack, but reating an emulator without Google Play did not work for me. I also checked on stackoverflow. What eventually worked for me was just removing all devices in my AVD Manager and starting fresh.

   - [x] (1pt) In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
   - [x] (1pt) In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.

- [ ] (2pts) Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring.
- [ ] (2pts) For popular movies (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars), the full backdrop image is displayed. Otherwise, a poster image, the movie title, and overview is listed. Use Heterogenous RecyclerViews and use different ViewHolder layout files for popular movies and less popular ones.

### Notes
The guided part of this unit was easy to follow, so I had no problems there. I had hoped to do more of the stretch projects, but was only able to complete the first 2 items. For the placeholder bonus item, although I used Glide to add a placeholder and added my image to the item_movie.xml, I believe I also need to add something to have it show before the API request is made.
